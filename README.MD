# Python Study

A particular but not private repository to centralize all studies about Python and a few famous Python's libraries.

As a topics guide, i will follow the Python's roadmap from this [link](https://roadmap.sh/python). The structure folder will follow the image structure. All extra material will be added in other folders.
