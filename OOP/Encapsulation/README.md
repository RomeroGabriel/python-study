# Encapsulation

This is section more about how to prevent some mistakes. Since Python give almost total freedom.

## Use Properties

1. Is a decorator
2. Can add validation on the property (typing validation, range value etc)
3. A lot code to achieve

## Use Descriptors

1. Encapsulate data creating new classes and use Python Functions __get__ __set__
2. Less code but more class

## Object Wrappers and Proxies

1. Better solution
2. Use Python Functions to get atributes

This is not good but since encapsulation is a subject with a lot discussion/problems so alright.
