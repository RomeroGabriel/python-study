# Decorators

Decorators is a structural design pattern. It gives the ability to attach new behaviors to objects/functions putting this objects/functions inside a special wrapper. [For more information about decorators](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator).
This is also called **metaprogramming** because a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time.
